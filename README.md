## Security checker
The Local PHP Security Checker is a command line tool that checks if your PHP application depends on PHP packages with known security vulnerabilities. It uses the Security Advisories Database behind the scenes.

Download a binary from the [releases page on Github](https://github.com/fabpot/local-php-security-checker/releases), rename it to local-php-security-checker and make it executable. From the application directory, run the binary without argument or flags to check for known vulnerabilities :
```
local-php-security-checker
```
